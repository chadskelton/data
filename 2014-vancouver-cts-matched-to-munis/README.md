Table matching Vancouver Census Tracts (CTUIDs) to Metro Vancouver municipalities (Census Subdivisions). Helpful for interactive maps because you can put the city that a CT is part of in a tooltip or pop-up window. Created in QGIS using a spatial join after turning the CT polygons into centroids first (got weird results when tried to join polygon to polygon).
