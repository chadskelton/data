City/regional descriptions for B.C. Forward Sortation Areas (FSAs). Scraped from this Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_V_postal_codes_of_Canada

Added separate file in May 2015 including whether the FSA is in Metro Vancouver or not and, for FSAs in the City of Vancouver, if they're on the westside, eastside or downtown. These were just based on looking at a map of the FSAs and manually adding in those desciptions.

FSAs are copyright Canada Post.
