*response_times_five-cities_2009-2014.xlsx*: Filtered data for just five named Metro Vancouver cities: Vancouver, Burnaby, Langley, Richmond and Surrey.

*MPDS_Codes_and_RAP_Changes.xlsx*: Spreadsheet provided by B.C. Ambulance indicating how various stages of the Resource Allocation Plan (RAP) re­-prioritized specific calls and what the "MPDS_Code" numbers in the raw data represent. Most, but not all, of the codes in the raw data are listed on this sheet.
