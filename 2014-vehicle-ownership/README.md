vehicle ownership

Raw data used in The Vancouver Sun's story on vehicle ownership patterns in Metro Vancouver. Two files here

vehicle-registration-data.xlsx: The raw data as it was provided by ICBC, with two small corrections. Original data had "Group18" as a model when it should be "MERCEDES BENZ" and "Group30" when it should be "ACURA".

vehicle-name-key: ICBC's raw data uses five-letter codes for vehicle models. This "decoder ring" can be used to replace the most popular models with the full model name. It won't work for all models in the data.
